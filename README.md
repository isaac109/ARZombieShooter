# ARZombieShooter
I plan to use the tool Vuforia to make an AR based game where the player is tasked with taking out zombies.

This project was a way for me to try out a new technology, while adding front-to-backend (or ui-to-db) work. In order to get the project to work you must print out the "depositphotos_53749217-Black-and-white-texture-of.jpg" image with the whole image visible. Vuforia uses this image to track where to place the scene in relation to the camera. Next, in the ARZombieShooter folder, take the highest AR_.apk and download it to an android device. From there, its a matter of starting a new game and having fun.
